## Future of e-learning starts today

Build a blazing-fast enterprise level headless Learning Management System in one month.

### What is Wellms?

Wellms is a headless system that enables immediate creation of dedicated training platforms, designed specifically to meet our Clients' most particular needs. We use it to set up content repositories with powerful administrative interfaces to support content development and management across multiple platforms.

#### The headless solution advantage

In headless architecture you can use any and all of the frontend frameworks and technologies you may think of. In opposition to monolith LMS architecture, a headless LMS is built upon API as a main component. All other components communicate through this interface. Furthermore you can create multiple frontend solutions working with the same backend.

### Wellms is exactly what you need

Quick to build no-code solution


Blazing-fast to use


Flexible in implementation

Creating an LMS is like using building blocks instead of carving in metal or molding a statue. This enterprise-level LMS can be up and running within a couple of weeks.

‚ÄúThe fastest and most efficient LMS as I ever used‚Äù - said 10/10 administrators that we showed Wellms to. There is no waste code, so it is as fast as Formula 1.

Flexible it feels like custom-made, as you decide which features you use. Yet, it will work, as it works for anyone else. No risk in creating complex specifications.


Block-based backend that grows with your needs


Reusable H5P content automatically adjusting to frontend


Tailor-made frontend adjusted to your needs

Adjusts to your needs as soon as they appear - you can attach an extra block anytime you need. Start small and allow our LMS to grow together with your organization.

Once you upload H5P content it is stored in a library and can be used in any number of courses. An edit done in the library is automatically displayed in all the courses.

The same H5P content will be displayed differently in different frontends - adjusted font, buttons colours and shapes and more.
